# Propylon Document Manager Assessment

The Propylon Document Management Technical Assessment is a simple (and incomplete) web application consisting of a basic API backend and a React based client.  This API/client can be used as a bootstrap to implement the specific features requested in the assessment description. 

## Getting Started
### API Development
The API project is a [Django/DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) project that utilizes a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for a convenient interface to access development utilities. This application uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as the default persistence database you are more than welcome to change this. This project requires Python 3.11 in order to create the virtual environment.  You will need to ensure that this version of Python is installed on your OS before building the virtual environment.  Running the below commmands should get the development environment running using the Django development server.
1. `$ make build` to create the virtual environment.
2. `$ make fixtures` to create a small number of fixture file versions.
3. `$ make serve` to start the development server on port 8001.
4. `$ make test` to run the limited test suite via PyTest.
### Client Development 
See the Readme [here](https://github.com/propylon/document-manager-assessment/blob/main/client/doc-manager/README.md)
